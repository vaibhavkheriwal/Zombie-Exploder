# Zombie Exploder

Zombie Exploder is a first-person shooter game for Windows, developed using the Unity game engine and C#.  
Set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, the game offers around 10â€“20 minutes of gameplay.  
While not a full-length title, it effectively showcases my skills in game development, including AI programming, level design, and UI creation.
